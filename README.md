Code used for the Oktoberfest video "BAC Lager."

Copy the /Photon code into the particle.io IDE and upload the /MicroView code to a MicroView module.

The code is beerware (seems appropriate); if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
